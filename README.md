# Multi-Level Security System Simulator 🛡️

A simulated 3-layer security clearance system built with **HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript**. This project demonstrates how multi-factor authentication (MFA) logic works in a web environment.

##  Security Levels
1. **Level 1: Authentication** - Master password verification.
2. **Level 2: Authorization** - 4-digit security code (OTP Simulation).
3. **Level 3: Access Override** - Secret decryption phrase check.

##  How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Follow the hints provided in the UI to bypass each level.

##  Technical Implementation
- **State Management:** Uses JavaScript functions to transition between "hidden" and "visible" states without page reloads.
- **UI Design:** Cyber-security themed dark interface using CSS Flexbox and Box-shadows.
- **Logic:** Conditional validation of user inputs before advancing the system state.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `index.html`: The structural layers of the security system.
- `style.css`: Cyber-theme styling and layout.
- `script.js`: Logic for validation and level transitions.
